# Attendance
The College Attendance System, aims at lowering the time taken by professors to take daily attendance of the students in class by digitizing it and putting it at the professor’s fingertips.
The project is fairly simple to use, has an easy learning curve and reports irregularities in student’s attendance. 
It is secured by a username/password login so that only professors can access it.
It reduces the redundancy of the data by storing the attendance in a proper and hierarchical manner.
